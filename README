Locking and shadow password retrieval code based on vlock 1.3

tss is a terminal screensaver for GNU/Linux and FreeBSD.

The first version, now over four years old, was meant to be a cheap copy of
FreeBSD's daemon saver.

This is a complete rewrite of the code, with many improvements:

- VT Locking (Shadow and BSD DB)
- ASCII Mirroring
- ASCII Autopadding
- ASCII direction selection
- Multiple colors in ASCII object
- Scrollbox showing uptime
- Random ASCII file selection
- Dynamic object speeds (ASCII, uname, scrollbox) 

Notice
======
If you notice any bugs that are not noted in src/main.c, 
please contact me.


Mirroring
=========
TSS can flip a buffer and correct characters which have substitutes for the
opposit direction.

This usually turns out quite nicely with most ASCII art.

tss supports automatic ascii padding since v0.7.8.4, so there is no longer
any need to manually pad out ascii with spaces in order for mirroring to
work properly.

Colors
======
Any character can be colored by prepending ESC plus a color value before the
character. The color will be set until an other color code is set. If several
escape sequences follow each other, last seen is used.

Colors are standard VT120, as initialised by curses:
	1 - Black
	2 - Red
	3 - Green
	4 - Yellow
	5 - Blue
	6 - Magenta
	7 - Cyan
	8 - White

Example:

	|5Hello,|
	|4This is a demo8|

This will make "Hello," blue, and "This is a demo" yellow.

Since the colors will "float" until an other color is interpreted, we can
manipulate the color of the uname and scrollbox from the ASCII.
The 8 at the end will make these objects white.

In order for color mirroring to work properly, make sure to repeat colors
so that they will be readable from both directions.

For example,

	|AAAA82hello28AAAA|

Will make the text "hello" red in both directions.

The default color is 8 (white).

Direction/nomirror
==================
If you want an ascii file to start in a specific direction, you can do this by
prepending ESC plus the letter "l" or "r" after it in the beginning of the file.

Example:

	|lThis is a demo|

If you do not want the ascii file to mirror at all, do the same as above but
with a "n" after ESC.

Locking
=======
For locking (the -l option) to work, this program requires suid. To do so, 
  su
  make
  chmod 4555 tss
  exit

If tss is called with -l in a VT, it will not be possible to shut it down
without entering the correct password.

Be careful!

Scrollbox
=========
The scrollbox will by default display the system load in 15 second intervals.
It was originally planned for this to take output from a shellscript, but I
see no real need for it. If someone still wants this feature, Contact me or
implement it yourself and e-mail it to me.

Random ASCII
============
Nothing magical. If you set -r, a random file will be used from /etc/tss/ or
~/.tss/ if the prior does not exist or contain any files.
